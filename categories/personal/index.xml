&lt;p>I have always wanted to start writing about various things I observe, am curious about and/or have an opinion on.
In most cases, these topics relate to mathematical optimization, which luckily is one of my -&lt;em>numerous&lt;/em>- passions but also my job (🤑).
I am also interested in aviation, food and pretty much anything that is &lt;em>smart&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have worked in a handful of companies ranging from airlines (✈️) to online retailers (💈), and from
consultancy (👔) to software product companies (🖥️).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hold a PhD in large scale mathematical optimization and I have 10+ years of experience in building optimizer
tools in different settings and with different duties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy cracking tough problems with mathematical optimization (🧮)
by enabling smart decision making. I also have interest in software engineering (⌨️).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data scientists are usually focused
on getting things done (🎯), &lt;em>which makes sense&lt;/em>. However, when developing an algorithm or modeling a problem,
on top of technical knowledge, a data scientist needs to rely on creativity (💡) and capability to &lt;em>think differently&lt;/em>.
The peace of mind that software craftsmanship (🛠️) provides is hence something you need, to &lt;em>solve&lt;/em> a problem.
(Will definitely write a post about my view on &lt;em>solving a problem&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am planning to start with a frequency of at least 1 post per month, aiming for a sustainable output rate.
I understand that content creation is a very sophisticated task, requiring high level of enthusiasm and discipline.
Well, I believe I just challenged myself into it 😁&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned! 🧑🏻‍💻🏃🏻‍♂️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NB: I took the cover picture. This is a place from my daily walking path, and I &lt;em>try&lt;/em> to take
the &lt;em>exact same&lt;/em> picture from the &lt;em>exact same&lt;/em> spot. Not sure what to do with those yet, but
I am positive that I can make something beautiful out of it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
