# 👋 Hello world (_duh_)

I am Serkan. 

I hold a PhD in large scale mathematical optimization and I have 10+ years of experience in building optimizer tools in different settings. 

I have always wanted to start writing about various things I observe and have an opinion on.
In most cases, these topics are about mathematical optimization, which luckily one of my  -_numerous_- passions but also my job (🤑).

I am hoping to start with a writing cadence of once a month (🤞).

Stay tuned! 🧑🏻‍💻🏃🏻‍♂️
