I am Serkan. 

I have always wanted to start writing about various things I observe, am curious about and/or have an opinion on.
In most cases, these topics are about mathematical optimization, which luckily one of my  -_numerous_- passions but also my job (🤑).

I have worked in a handful of companies ranging from airlines (✈️) to online retailers (💈), and from
consultancy (👔) to software product companies (🖥️). 

I hold a PhD in large scale mathematical optimization and I have 10+ years of experience in building optimizer tools in different settings
and with different duties.

I enjoy cracking tough problems
with mathematical optimization (🧮) by enabling smart decision making.
I also have interest in software engineering (⌨️). 

Data scientists are usually focused
on getting things done (🎯), _which makes sense_. However, when developing an algorithm or modeling a problem,
on top of technical knowledge, a data scientist needs to rely on creativity (💡) and capability to _think differently_.
The peace of mind that software craftsmanship (🛠️) provides is hence something you need to _solve_ a problem.
(Will definitely write a post about what _solving a problem_ means, imho of course).

I am planning to start with a cadence of at least 1 post per month, aiming for a sustainable output rate.
I understand that content creation is a very sophisticated task, requiring high level of enthusiasm and discipline.
Well, I believe I just challenged myself into it 😁

Stay tuned! 🧑🏻‍💻🏃🏻‍♂️

NB: I took the cover picture. This is a place from my daily walking path, and I _try_ to take
the exact same picture from the exact same spot. Not sure what to do with those yet, but 
I am positive that I can make something beautiful out of it.
