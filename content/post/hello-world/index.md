I am Serkan. 

I hold a PhD in large scale mathematical optimization and I have 10+ years of experience in building optimizer tools in different settings. 

I have always wanted to start writing about various things I observe and have an opinion on.
In most cases, these topics are about mathematical optimization, which luckily one of my  -_numerous_- passions but also my job (🤑).

I have worked in a handful of companies ranging from online retailers (💈) to airlines (✈️) and
to consultancy (👔) and software product companies (🖥️). 

I enjoy cracking tough problems
with mathematical optimization (🧮) by enabling smart decision making.
I also have interest in software engineering (⌨️). 

Data scientists are usually focused
on getting things done (🎯), _which makes sense_. However, the peace of mind that software craftsmanship (🛠️) 
provides when developing an algorithm or modeling a problem is what you need
to unlock the potential. And the creativity (💡) and/or _deep work_ is what you need, if you want to _solve_ a hard problem. 

(Will definitely write a post about what _solving a problem_ means, imho of course).

Stay tuned! 🧑🏻‍💻🏃🏻‍♂️
